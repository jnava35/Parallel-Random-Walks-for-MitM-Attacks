# HW2 Spark/Graph X

NetID: jnava35@uic.edu | UIN: 660115946 | Repo for HW1 CS 441


Setting up Project

1. Download repo from git
2. Open project in intelliJ 
3. Next we have to setup the SDK. The SDK we will be using is 1.8 and the Scala version we will be using is 2.13.10
   The reason for this is because Spark is compatible with certain versions
4. To do the above open intelij and go to `file -> Project Structure -> Modules -> Dependencies -> Module SDK` Select Version 1.8
5. 


From the terminal, run `sbt clean compile`
